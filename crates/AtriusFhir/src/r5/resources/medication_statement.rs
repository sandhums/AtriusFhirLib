/// A record of a medication that is being consumed by a patient. A
/// MedicationStatement may indicate that the patient may be taking the
/// medication now or has taken the medication in the past or will be taking the
/// medication in the future. The source of this information can be the patient,
/// significant other (such as a family member or spouse), or a clinician. A
/// common scenario where this information is captured is during the history
/// taking process during a patient visit or stay. The medication information may
/// come from sources such as the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle,
/// or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party
/// maintains.
/// 
/// The primary difference between a medicationstatement and a
/// medicationadministration is that the medication administration has complete
/// administration information and is based on actual administration information
/// from the person who administered the medication. A medicationstatement is
/// often, if not always, less specific. There is no required date/time when the
/// medication was administered, in fact we only know that a source has reported
/// the patient is taking this medication, where details such as time, quantity,
/// or rate or even medication product may be incomplete or missing or less
/// precise. As stated earlier, the Medication Statement information may come
/// from the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle or from a list of
/// medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains. Medication
/// administration is more formal and is not missing detailed information.
