/// FHIR Composition type
/// 
/// A set of healthcare-related information that is assembled together into a
/// single logical package that provides a single coherent statement of meaning,
/// establishes its own context and that has clinical attestation with regard to
/// who is making the statement. A Composition defines the structure and
/// narrative content necessary for a document. However, a Composition alone does
/// not constitute a document. Rather, the Composition must be the first entry in
/// a Bundle where Bundle.type=document, and any other resources referenced from
/// Composition must be included as subsequent entries in the Bundle (for example
/// Patient, Practitioner, Encounter, etc.).
/// 
/// ## Purpose
/// To support documents, and also to capture the EN13606 notion of an attested commit to the patient EHR, and to allow a set of disparate resources at the information/engineering level to be gathered into a clinical statement.
