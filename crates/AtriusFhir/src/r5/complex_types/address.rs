/// FHIR Address type
/// 
/// Address Type: An address expressed using postal conventions (as opposed to
/// GPS or other location definition formats). This data type may be used to
/// convey addresses for use in delivering mail as well as for visiting locations
/// which might not be valid for mail delivery. There are a variety of postal
/// address formats defined around the world.
/// The ISO21090-codedString may be used to provide a coded representation of the
/// contents of strings in an Address.
/// 
/// ## Purpose
/// Need to be able to record postal addresses, along with notes about their use.
/// 
/// ## Type: Complex-type type
/// Base type: http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DataType
/// 
/// ## Status: active
/// FHIR Version: 5.0.0
/// 
/// See: [Address](http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Address)
