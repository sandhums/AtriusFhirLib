/// Identifier Type: An identifier - identifies some entity uniquely and

/// ## Purpose
/// Need to be able to identify things with confidence and be sure that the identification is not subject to misinterpretation.
/// 
/// ## Type: Complex-type type
/// Base type: http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DataType
/// 
/// ## Status: active
/// FHIR Version: 5.0.0
/// 
/// See: [Identifier](http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Identifier)
