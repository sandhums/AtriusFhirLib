/// FHIR CodeableConcept type
/// 
/// CodeableConcept Type: A concept that may be defined by a formal reference to
/// a terminology or ontology or may be provided by text.
/// 
/// ## Purpose
/// This is a common pattern in healthcare - a concept that may be defined by one or more codes from formal definitions including LOINC and SNOMED CT, and/or defined by the provision of text that captures a human sense of the concept.
/// 
/// ## Type: Complex-type type
/// Base type: http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DataType
/// 
/// ## Status: active
/// FHIR Version: 5.0.0
/// 
/// See: [CodeableConcept](http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/CodeableConcept)

    /// extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
    /// requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

    /// ## Implementation Notes
    /// There can be no stigma associated with the use of extensions by any
    /// application, project, or standard - regardless of the institution or
    /// jurisdiction that uses or defines the extensions. The use of extensions is
