    /// ## Implementation Notes
    /// When an identifier is provided in place of a reference, any system processing

    /// based reference untouched, resolve it, and/or reject it - see
    /// CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.referencePolicy.
    /// 
    /// When both an identifier and a literal reference are provided, the literal
    /// reference is preferred. Applications processing the resource are allowed -
    /// but not required - to check that the identifier matches the literal reference
    /// 
    /// Applications converting a logical reference to a literal reference may choose
    /// to leave the logical reference present, or remove it.
    /// 
    /// Reference is intended to point to a structure that can potentially be
    /// expressed as a FHIR resource, though there is no need for it to exist as an
    /// actual FHIR resource instance - except in as much as an application wishes to
    /// actual find the target of the reference. The content referred to be the
    /// identifier must meet the logical constraints implied by any limitations on
    /// what resource types are permitted for the reference. For example, it would
    /// not be legitimate to send the identifier for a drug prescription if the type
    /// were Reference(Observation|DiagnosticReport). One of the use-cases for
    /// Reference.identifier is the situation where no FHIR representation exists
    /// (where the type is Reference (Any).
