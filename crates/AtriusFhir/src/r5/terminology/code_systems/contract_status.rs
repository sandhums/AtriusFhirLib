///FHIR CodeSystem: ContractStatus
///Canonical URL: http://hl7.org/fhir/contract-status
///Version: 5.0.0
///Title: Contract Status
///Status: active
///This CodeSystem contains FHIR-defined contract status types. Each definition includes usage notes explaining the precedence order in contract lifecycle - i.e., while only some stages are required, the order in which they may occur is deterministic; and a map to comparable FHIR and v.3 status codes. It follows guidance about use of status codes in FHIR in [the Status Codes Grid](sc.html).
