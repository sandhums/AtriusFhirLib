/// FHIR ImplementationGuide type
/// 
/// A set of rules of how a particular interoperability or standards problem is
/// solved - typically through the use of FHIR resources. This resource is used
/// to gather all the parts of an implementation guide into a logical whole and
/// to publish a computable definition of all the parts.
/// 
/// ## Purpose
/// An implementation guide is able to define default profiles that must apply to any use of a resource, so validation services may need to take one or more implementation guide resources when validating.
/// 
/// ## Type: Resource type

/// ## Status: draft
/// FHIR Version: 4.0.1
