/// Knowledge resources must be able to provide enough information for consumers of the content (and/or interventions or results produced by the content) to be able to determine and understand the justification for and evidence in support of the content.
/// 
/// ## Type: Complex-type type
/// Base type: http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Element
/// 
/// ## Status: draft
/// FHIR Version: 4.0.1
