    /// * If a system uses mapping tables to generate resources (e.g., a facade
    ///   server), updates to those tables might not be reflected in `lastUpdated`
    ///   but do result in a difference of retrieved resource content.
    /// 
    /// * If a system generates resources from internal data (e.g., a facade server),
    ///   the system's internal `lastUpdated` value might be changed due to changes
    ///   that are not visible on FHIR resources (e.g., extended data has been
    ///   changed).
    /// 
    /// * If a system updates an element that a particular client does not have
    ///   access to (e.g., prevented by privacy rules), the `lastUpdated` value might
    ///   be changed even though there are no visible changes in resource content.
    ///
