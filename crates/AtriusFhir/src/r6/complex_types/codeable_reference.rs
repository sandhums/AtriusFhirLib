/// FHIR CodeableReference type
/// 
/// CodeableReference Type: A reference to a resource (by instance), or instead,
/// a reference to a concept defined in a terminology or ontology (by class).
/// 
/// ## Purpose
/// This is a common pattern in record keeping - a reference may be made to a specific condition, observation, plan, or definition, or a reference may be made to a general concept defined in a knowledge base somewhere.
/// 
/// ## Type: Complex-type type
/// Base type: http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DataType
/// 
/// ## Status: active
/// FHIR Version: 6.0.0-ballot3
/// 
/// See: [CodeableReference](http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/CodeableReference)

    /// requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

    /// There can be no stigma associated with the use of extensions by any
    /// application, project, or standard - regardless of the institution or
