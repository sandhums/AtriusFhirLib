    /// ## Requirements
    /// Identifies the speed with which the medication was or will be introduced into
    /// the patient. Typically the rate for an infusion e.g. 100 ml per 1 hour or 100
    /// ml/hr. May also be expressed as a rate per unit of time e.g. 500 ml per 2
    /// hours. Other examples: 200 mcg/min or 200 mcg/1 minute; 1 liter/8 hours.
    /// Sometimes, a rate can imply duration when expressed as total volume /
    /// duration (e.g. 500mL/2 hours implies a duration of 2 hours). However, when
    /// rate doesn't imply duration (e.g. 250mL/hour), then the
    /// timing.repeat.duration is needed to convey the infuse over time period.
    /// 
    /// ## Implementation Notes
    /// It is possible to supply both a rate and a doseQuantity to provide full
    /// details about how the medication is to be administered and supplied. If the
    /// rate is intended to change over time, depending on local rules/regulations,
    /// each change should be captured as a new version of the MedicationRequest with
    /// an updated rate, or captured with a new MedicationRequest with the new rate.
    /// 
    /// It is possible to specify a rate over time (for example, 100 ml/hour) using
    /// either the rateRatio and rateQuantity. The rateQuantity approach requires
    /// systems to have the capability to parse UCUM grammar where ml/hour is
    /// included rather than a specific ratio where the time is specified as the
    /// denominator. Where a rate such as 500ml over 2 hours is specified, the use of
    /// rateRatio may be more semantically correct than specifying using a
    /// rateQuantity of 250 mg/hour. Expression is provided for medications that are
    /// e.g. weight dependent, or skin surface are dependent.
    ///
