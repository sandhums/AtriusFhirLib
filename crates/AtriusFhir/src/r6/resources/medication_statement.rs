/// A record of a medication consumed by a patient. A MedicationStatement may

/// medication in the past or will be taking the medication in the future. The
/// source of this information can be the patient, patient representative (e.g.,
/// spouse, significant other, family member, caregiver), or a clinician. A
/// common scenario where this information is captured is during the history
/// taking process during a patient encounter or stay. The medication information
/// may come from sources such as the patient's memory, from a prescription
/// bottle, or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party
/// maintains. The primary difference between a MedicationStatement and a
/// MedicationAdministration is that the medication administration has complete
/// administration information and is based on actual administration information
/// from the person who administered the medication. A MedicationStatement is
/// often, if not always, less specific. There is no required date/time when the
/// medication was administered, in fact we only know that a source has reported
/// the patient is taking this medication, where details such as time, quantity,
/// or rate or even medication product may be incomplete or missing or less
/// precise. As stated earlier, the MedicationStatement information may come from
/// the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle or from a list of
/// medications the patient, clinician or other party. MedicationAdministration
/// is more formal and is not missing detailed information.
