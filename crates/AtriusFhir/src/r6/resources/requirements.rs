    /// Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
    /// or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension

    /// 
    /// ## Requirements
    /// Modifier extensions allow for extensions that *cannot* be safely ignored to
    /// be clearly distinguished from the vast majority of extensions which can be
    /// safely ignored. This promotes interoperability by eliminating the need for
    /// implementers to prohibit the presence of extensions. For further information,
    /// see the [definition of modifier
    /// extensions](extensibility.html#modifierExtension).
    /// 
    /// ## Implementation Notes
    /// There can be no stigma associated with the use of extensions by any
    /// application, project, or standard - regardless of the institution or
    /// jurisdiction that uses or defines the extensions. The use of extensions is
    /// what allows the FHIR specification to retain a core level of simplicity for
    /// everyone.

    /// - Included in summary
