    /// definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
    /// in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
    /// descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
    /// make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
    /// governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
    /// implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that
    /// SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
    /// processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

    /// or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
    /// itself).

    /// Modifier extensions allow for extensions that *cannot* be safely ignored to
    /// be clearly distinguished from the vast majority of extensions which can be
    /// safely ignored. This promotes interoperability by eliminating the need for
    /// implementers to prohibit the presence of extensions. For further information,
    /// see the [definition of modifier
    /// extensions](extensibility.html#modifierExtension).

    /// ## Implementation Notes
    /// There can be no stigma associated with the use of extensions by any
    /// application, project, or standard - regardless of the institution or
    /// jurisdiction that uses or defines the extensions. The use of extensions is
    /// what allows the FHIR specification to retain a core level of simplicity for
