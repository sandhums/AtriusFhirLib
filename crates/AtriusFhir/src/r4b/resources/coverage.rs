    /// be clearly distinguished from the vast majority of extensions which can be
    /// safely ignored. This promotes interoperability by eliminating the need for
    /// implementers to prohibit the presence of extensions. For further information,

    /// extensions](extensibility.html#modifierExtension).

    /// what allows the FHIR specification to retain a core level of simplicity for
