/// 
/// Base StructureDefinition for SampledData Type: A series of measurements taken

/// ## Purpose
/// There is a need for a concise way to handle the data produced by devices that sample a physical state at a high frequency.
/// 
/// ## Type: Complex-type type
/// Base type: http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Element
/// 
/// ## Status: draft
/// FHIR Version: 4.3.0
/// 
/// See: [SampledData](http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/SampledData)
